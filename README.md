## Introduction 
This project is a platform game named "**P0keMonE**" inspired by the Pokémon game series. This documentation covers the analysis, design, and relevant diagrams for the development of the game.

## Gameplay :video_game:

### Original Game
The game we are developing is inspired by the game [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Red_and_Blue). The concept of the original game is simple: the player starts in a small village and must build a team of Pokémon to become the best trainer. The player can move freely on the map and fight Pokémon to capture them.

### Modified Version
In our version of the game, the player must form a team of three Pokémon to face the final boss. They must train their Pokémon and compose the best possible team. To obtain new Pokémon, the player must level up, which gives them the opportunity to choose from three new Pokémon and possibly replace a member of their existing team. The game offers an adventure and strategy experience where the player must make crucial decisions to succeed in becoming the best trainer and defeating the final boss. If all the player's Pokémon are knocked out, the game is lost.
